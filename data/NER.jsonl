Anāthapiṇḍada. On that occasion some monks [F.278.a] caught an autumn
disease. Because they had caught an autumn disease, they turned pale,
became emaciated, lost their strength, and were weakened."}
{"text": "1.3 The buddhas, the blessed ones, ask though they already know. The
Buddha, the Blessed One, asked the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, why have
these monks turned pale, become emaciated, lost their strength, and been
weakened?”"}

autumn disease. Because they caught an autumn disease, they have turned
pale, become emaciated, lost their strength, and been weakened.”"}
{"text": "1.5 “Ānanda,” said the Blessed One, “on account of that, I authorize monks
to consume medicines.”"}
{"text": "1.6 When the Blessed One said “monks may consume medicines,” the monks
consumed medicines at the appropriate time (morning) but did not
consume them after the appropriate time, because they were monks who
were in the habit of eating at the appropriate time. Therefore, the monks
turned pale, became emaciated, lost their strength, and were weakened."}
{"text": "1.7 The buddhas, the blessed ones, ask though they already know. The
Buddha, the Blessed One, asked the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, I said
‘monks may consume medicines.’ Why, then, have these monks turned pale,
become emaciated, lost their strength, and been weakened?”"}
